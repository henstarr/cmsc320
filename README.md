This repository contains my Data Science class projects.

##Final Project
-> Provided a dataset of movies provided from IMDB, performed data cleaning, data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, modeling, and testing. Utilized sklearn AI and used random forest modeling to determine the most important feature for determining whether a movie was a "success" or not. Employed sentiment analysis to provide sentiment ratings to reviews.
##Data Cleaning
-> Contains a massive amount of data cleaning on results of a Google survey to process information and answer three important questions about the topics. Utilized statistical correlation techniques to determine whether target variables were statistically significant in answering the questions.
